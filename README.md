# Chain Visual Explorer (CVE)
  A multichain visual explorer which traces the entire history of a transaction on any wallet address and illustrates it  in a tree diagram. 
using tree diagram.

**Supported chains:**
- Ethereum
- Base
- Optimism
- Arbitrum One
- Avalanche C-Chain
- Fantom
- Polygon

## Problem We Are Solving
This year, over $1.2 Billion have been lost to Hacks and rug Pulls. 
Companies and Security researchers spend a lot of time struggling to trace the transaction flow to discover the instance where the Hack took place. This is quite a daunting, error-prone and time-consuming experience.

## Solution
 We present to you CVE (Chain Visual Explorer), a Multichain Visual Explorer that automatically traces and illustrates the entire history and transaction flow of funds of any wallet address. We make use of a tree diagram to illustrate the transaction for a more visual and easy-to-understand experience.

## Benefits of CVE
-   It saves users and companies time.
-   It reduces the risk of human error while tracing a transaction flow.
-   It alerts investors of malicious activity of a wallet such as if an address has been linked with a rug pull contract or HoneyPot Hack.

# Technologies Used -
Chainbase API, TypeScript, Next.js ,
