## Problem
 People struggle to track the movement of funds on the Ethereum blockchain, especially when there is a hack. This is because they need to manually scroll through and examine every related transaction on Etherscan, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution
 We have built a platform that solves this problem by automatically tracing and illustrating the entire history and destination of funds on any Ethereum wallet address. It uses a web diagram to make the information easy to understand and visualize. All you need to do is enter the wallet address and we automatically show all the wallets and transactions. 

Here are some of the benefits of our platform:
-   It saves users time and eliminates the risk of human error when tracing the movement of funds.
-   It helps investors to protect themselves from fraud by alerting them if an address has been linked with a rug pull contract or honey pot.

## Technology

-   Chainbase API
-   TypeScript
-   Next.js
